# idevice

A Rust library for interacting with iOS services.
Inspired by [libimobiledevice](https://github.com/libimobiledevice/libimobiledevice)
and [pymobiledevice3](https://github.com/doronz88/pymobiledevice3),
this library interfaces with lockdownd and usbmuxd to perform actions
on an iOS device that a Mac normally would.

## State

**IMPORTANT**: Breaking changes will happen at each point release until 0.2.0.
Pin your `Cargo.toml` to a specific version to avoid breakage.

This library is in development and research stage.
Releases are being published to crates.io for use in other projects,
but the API and feature-set are far from final or even planned.

## Features

To keep dependency bloat and compile time down, everything is contained in features.

| Feature                | Description |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `afc`                  | Apple File Conduit for file system access.|
| `amfi`                 | Apple mobile file integrity service |
| `core_device_proxy`    | Start a secure tunnel to access protected services. |
| `crashreportcopymobile`| Copy crash reports.|
| `debug_proxy`          | Send GDB commands to the device.|
| `diagnostics_relay`    | Access device diagnostics information (IORegistry, MobileGestalt, battery, NAND, device control).|
| `dvt`                  | Access Apple developer tools (e.g. Instruments).|
| `heartbeat`            | Maintain a heartbeat connection.|
| `house_arrest` | Manage files in app containers |
| `installation_proxy`   | Manage app installation and uninstallation.|
| `springboardservices`  | Control SpringBoard (e.g. UI interactions). Partial support.|
| `misagent`             | Manage provisioning profiles on the device.|
| `mobilebackup2`        | Manage backups.|
| `mobile_image_mounter` | Manage DDI images.|
| `location_simulation`  | Simulate GPS locations on the device.|
| `pair`                 | Pair the device.|
| `syslog_relay` | Relay system logs from the device |
| `tcp`                  | Connect to devices over TCP.|
| `tunnel_tcp_stack`     | Naive in-process TCP stack for `core_device_proxy`.|
| `tss`                  | Make requests to Apple's TSS servers. Partial support.|
| `tunneld`              | Interface with [pymobiledevice3](https://github.com/doronz88/pymobiledevice3)'s tunneld. |
| `usbmuxd`              | Connect using the usbmuxd daemon.|
| `xpc`                  | Access protected services via XPC over RSD. |

### Planned/TODO

Finish the following:

- springboard

Implement the following:

- companion_proxy
- diagnostics
- mobilebackup2
- notification_proxy
- screenshot
- webinspector

As this project is done in my free time within my busy schedule, there
is no ETA for any of these. Feel free to contribute or donate!

## Usage

idevice is purposefully verbose to allow for powerful configurations.
No size fits all, but effort is made to reduce boilerplate via providers.

```rust
// enable the usbmuxd feature
use idevice::{lockdown::LockdowndClient, IdeviceService};
use idevice::usbmuxd::{UsbmuxdAddr, UsbmuxdConnection},

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    // usbmuxd is Apple's daemon for connecting to devices over USB.
    // We'll ask usbmuxd for a device
    let mut usbmuxd = UsbmuxdConnection::default()
        .await
        .expect("Unable to connect to usbmxud")
    let devs = usbmuxd.get_devices().unwrap();
    if devs.is_empty() {
        eprintln!("No devices connected!");
        return;
    }

    // Create a provider to automatically create connections to the device.
    // Many services require opening multiple connections to get where you want.
    let provider = devs[0].to_provider(UsbmuxdAddr::from_env_var().unwrap(), 0, "example-program")

    // ``connect`` takes an object with the provider trait
    let mut lockdown_client = match LockdowndClient::connect(&provider).await {
        Ok(l) => l,
        Err(e) => {
            eprintln!("Unable to connect to lockdown: {e:?}");
            return;
        }
    };

    println!("{:?}", lockdown_client.get_value("ProductVersion").await);
    println!(
        "{:?}",
        lockdown_client
            .start_session(
                &provider
                    .get_pairing_file()
                    .await
                    .expect("failed to get pairing file")
            )
            .await
    );
    println!("{:?}", lockdown_client.idevice.get_type().await.unwrap());
    println!("{:#?}", lockdown_client.get_all_values().await);
}
```

More examples are in the ``tools`` crate and in the crate documentation.

## FFI

For use in other languages, a small FFI crate has been created to start exposing
idevice. Example C programs can be found in this repository.

## Version Policy

As Apple prohibits downgrading to older versions, this library will
not keep compatibility for older versions than the current stable release.

## Developer Disk Images

doronz88 is kind enough to maintain a [repo](https://github.com/doronz88/DeveloperDiskImage)
for disk images and personalized images.
On MacOS, you can find them at ``~/Library/Developer/DeveloperDiskImages``.
